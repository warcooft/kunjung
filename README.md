# Visitor Tracking System for CodeIgniter Shield
A lightweight visitor tracking system for CodeIgniter Shield, designed to monitor user profile visits similar to LinkedInâ€™s profile visitor feature.

# Install
Install easily via Composer to take advantage of CodeIgniter 4's autoloading capabilities and always be up-to-date:
```
composer require aselsan/visitors
```

Once the files are downloaded and included in the autoload, run any library migrations to ensure the database is set up correctly:
```
php spark migrate --all
```

# Configuration
Add `HasVisitors` trait to your users model and initialize visitors with `initVisitors()` method.

```php
class ExampleUsersModel extends BaseModel
{
    use HasVisitors;

    // ...

    protected function initialize()
    {
        $this->initVisitors();
    }

    // ...
}
```

And if you use Entity class, add `Visitable` trait to it:

```php
class ExampleUser extends Entity
{
    use Visitable;

    // ...
}
```

# Usage
### Visit a User
To record a visit to a specific user's profile:
```php
$users = auth()->getProvider();
$user  = $users->find($id);

// Record a visit to this user
$user->visit();
```
### Get a User with Visitor Information
To retrieve a user along with their visitors:
```php
$users = auth()->getProvider();
$user  = $users->withVisitors()->find($id);

// Get total number of visitors
$user->getSumVisitors();

// Get detailed visitor information
$user->visitors;
```
